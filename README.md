## [How do I get set up?](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/UPMInstallation.html)

The recommended way to add the Unity UI Toolkit Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the Unity Package Manager to reference the project to install it

The primary method for install is to use OpenUPM to add the package, it can be installed using the following [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/) command:

> Coming Soon!

```cli
`openupm add com.unity.uitoolkitextensions`
```

> For more details on using [OpenUPM CLI, check the docs here](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation).

- Unity Package Manager - manual

Alternatively, you can also add the package manually through the Unity package manager using the scope ```com.unity.uitoolkitextensions```, see the [Unity Package Manager docs](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/the-package-manager) for more information.

## [Contribution guidelines](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/ContributionGuidelines)

Got a script you want added? Then just fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/unity-UI-Extensions/com.unity.uitoolkitextensions) and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)

Just ensure:

- The header of the script should match the standard used in all scripts.
- The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments.
- (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible. (editor options are in the Editor\UIToolkitExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)
